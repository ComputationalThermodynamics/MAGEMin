Problem definition
==================

Finding the most stable phase assemblage is a challenging constrained optimization problem including both equality and inequality constraints. One has to minimize the Gibbs energy (1) of the system while satisfying the Gibbs-Duhem (2) and mass equality constraints (3) while satisfying the mixing-in-sites inequality constraints (4).

1. Total Gibbs energy
**********************

The Gibbs energy of a multi-component multiphase system is given by the weighted summation of the chemical potentials of all end-members and pure phases:

.. math::
   G_{sys} = \sum_{\lambda=1}^{\Lambda} n_{\lambda} \sum_{i=1}^{N_{\lambda}} \mu_{i}(\lambda) p_{i}(\lambda) + \sum_{\omega=1}^{\Omega} n_{\omega} \mu_{\omega} 

where  

.. math:: 
   n_{\lambda} 
   
is the molar fraction of the solution phase.

.. math:: 
   p_{\lambda} 
   
is the molar fraction of the endmembers

.. math:: 
   n_{\omega} 
   
is the molar fraction of the pure phase.

The chemical potential of a phase is either a constant for a condensed (pure) phase:

.. math:: 
   \mu_{i} = G_{i}^{0}

or a function for a phase within a solution:

.. math:: 
   \mu_{i} = G_{i}^{0} + RTlog(a_{i}) + G_{i}^{ex}

where

.. math::
   a_{i}

is the thermochemical activity related to the mole fraction and the activity coefficient by

.. math::
   a_{i} = x_{i} \gamma_{i}


For the case of ideal mixing between the end-members, the activity coefficient is unity. The mixing of a species dissolved in a condensed phase, however rarely behaves ideally
and is typically a function of both temperature and composition (mixing-on-sites formulation).

2. Gibbs-Duhem constraint
*************************

The Gibbs-Duhem constraint is defined as

.. math:: 
   \sum_{j=1}^{C} \Gamma_{j} a_{ij} - \mu_{i} = 0
   
where

.. math:: 
	\Gamma_{j}

is the chemical potential of pure component (oxide) j

and

.. math:: 
	a_{ij}
	
is the molar compositional of component j in end-member/pure phase i

3. Mass constraint
******************

The mass equality constraint is defined as

.. math::
   \sum_{\lambda=1}^{\Lambda} n_{\lambda} \sum_{i=1}^{N_{\lambda}} a_{ij}(\lambda) p_{i}(\lambda) + \sum_{\omega=1}^{\Omega} n_{\omega} a_{\omega j} - b_j = 0

where

.. math::
   a_{ij}
   
is the molar composition of component j in end-member i

and

.. math::
   a_{\omega j}
   
is the molar composition of component j in a pure phase

Minimization approach 
=====================

The Gibbs minimization approach employed in MAGEMin combines discretization of the equations of state in composition space with linear programming and extends the mass constrained Gibbs-hyperplane rotation method to account for the mixing-on-sites that takes place in silicate mineral solid solutions. For an exhaustive description of the methodology see Riel et (submitted).
